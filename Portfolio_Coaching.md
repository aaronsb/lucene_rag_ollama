Portfolio Coaching

A Cprime Portfolio Coaching is provided by a specialist who coaches a
lean portfolio (ex., business unit, traditional portfolio) with the
intent of establishing competency with Lean Portfolio Management. The
Cprime Portfolio Coaching works with corporate executives, portfolio
owners and portfolio team members to systematically implement portfolio
practices that optimize corporate strategy deployment and execution.
Portfolio Coaching pairs with key stakeholders to understand current
structure and execution model, train on key portfolio practices, and
coach portfolio level people to self-sufficiency in executing identified
portfolio roles identified. The expected outcomes include improved
alignment to strategy, more disciplined portfolio operations and better
visibility into portfolio results. Specifically, the Cprime Portfolio
Coach will work with key portfolio stakeholders to create a prioritized
backlog of work related to the following scope:

-   understanding what it will take to move from current state portfolio
    operations

-   establishing proper roles in the Lean Portfolio Management team

-   clearly represent differentiating business outcomes to the people in
    the portfolio

-   defining a modern system for efficiently and effectively evaluating,
    approving and prioritizing major initiatives

-   creating visibility and alignment across your entire portfolio

-   developing smart measures to evaluate portfolio effectiveness

-   instantiating adaptive mechanisms to govern operations and value
    delivery

-   improving capability to make strategic pivots

-   accelerating the shift to product thinking

-   implementing modern, effective measurements for business results

-   introducing modern funding mechanisms

Cprime will provide ongoing coaching to the Portfolio as those
performing Portfolio roles execute the work. The Cprime coach(es) will
pair with portfolio roles to demonstrate, co-lead, observe and coach
Portfolio activities. The exact Portfolio coaching backlog will be
determined in partnership with executive stakeholders (ex., Lean Agile
Center of Excellence or other leadership) based on agreed-upon desirable
outcomes. Typical portfolio coaching includes:
